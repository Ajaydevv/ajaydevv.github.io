# GitHub Pages MIME Type Fix

## Issue
The error "Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of 'application/octet-stream'" occurs when GitHub Pages doesn't serve JavaScript modules with the correct MIME type.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added .nojekyll File
- Created `.nojekyll` file in repository root
- This tells GitHub Pages to bypass Jekyll processing
- Prevents Jekyll from interfering with static assets

### 2. Updated Vite Configuration
- Added `target: "es2015"` for better browser compatibility
- Improved chunk naming with proper file extensions
- Added `global: 'globalThis'` for polyfill support
- Better asset organization in `assets/` directory

### 3. Enhanced Build Process
- Updated package.json to copy `.nojekyll` to dist folder
- Split deploy into `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts
- Ensures `.nojekyll` is always included in deployment

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow
- Added step to create `.nojekyll` in dist folder during CI/CD
- Uses `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` for reliable deployment
- Includes environment variables for Supabase configuration

### 5. Added Headers Configuration
- Created `public/_headers` file for MIME type declarations
- Ensures proper Content-Type headers for JavaScript files

## Deployment Commands

### Manual Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### GitHub Actions (Automatic)
- Push to main branch triggers deployment
- Environment variables configured in GitHub Secrets

## File Structure
```
├── .nojekyll                 # Bypass Jekyll processing
├── public/
│   └── _headers             # MIME type configuration
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml       # GitHub Actions workflow
└── dist/                    # Build output (includes .nojekyll)
```

## Verification
After deployment, the app should load properly at:

The JavaScript modules will be served with correct MIME types, resolving the module script error.
